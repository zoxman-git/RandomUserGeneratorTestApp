# RandomUserGeneratorTestApp

TODO... Maybe...?

- Additional unit tests for controller=
- Integration tests?
- Performance tests?
- Add any additional comments to code as necessary
- Code review/feedback?
- Further validation - e.g. max request size perhaps
- Could move serialization for file response to middleware or somewhere more central, if/as needed by other new endpoints
- Application structure and architecture, etc may evolve as patterns develop, context and domain space grows, etc
- Better logging, reporting and exception handling
- Standard approach to error handling and responses shown to consumers
- Get Accept header working in Swagger, maybe...?
